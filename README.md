# foopsss' spec files repository.
This is a repository created to store spec files I made to package software for the RPM packaging system. These files are maintained by me and not officially supported by any distribution that uses RPM in any form. At the moment, there are spec files for the following programs:

| Program | URL |
|---|---|
| shell-color-scripts (available on [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/foopsss/shell-color-scripts)) | [https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts) |
| HP Laser 100 and HP Color Laser 150 printer series drivers (PPD only) | [https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laser-100-printer-series/24494339/model/24494371](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laser-100-printer-series/24494339/model/24494371) |
